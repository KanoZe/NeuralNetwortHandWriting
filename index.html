      draw on the canvas, once you're done drawing, press the Train pattern button, for each letter to be guessable <br>
      you have to draw it 3 times. While training a letter you shoudln't change the input in the Letter input textbox.

    <section>
      If a guess was wrong, you could correct the weight of the letter so that future guesses are more accurate.<br>
      So after a guess, if it's wrong, input the letter that was supposed to be guessed, (Ex. if you drew 2 input 2) in <br>
      the text box below, and then press the correct output button. This will keep correcting the letter weight until it's correct.<br>
      You can see how many times the letter weight had to be modified for your last guess to become correct in the console <br>
